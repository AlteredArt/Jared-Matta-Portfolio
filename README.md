# Jared-Matta-Portfolio
  Hello, and welcome to my personal Portfolio. My name is Jared Matta, I just recently graduated from Flatiron immersive full-stack software engineering course, and I looking for my first full-time position as a Software Engineer. I have experience building applications with Javascript, React, Redux, Django, Ruby, Adobe, with a hands-on experience to React VR. I have also recently started diving into C++, which i find very interesting. I am open to learning new frameworks, languages, and libraries, or even relocating to fit your companies needs.  I am currently working freelance as part-time work, all while researching your company and the products you have produced.

  Please feel free to check outmy projects, blogs, and extra achievments. I built this personally with:
Javascript: For functionality
HTML: For the layout
CSS: For all the wonderful styling you see

  Since this is my Personal Portfolio, I ask that no cloning be done of this code. If you would like advice on making your own portfolio similar to mine, please feel free to contact me, and as always Enjoy!
